# Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple interface for displaying temperature and humidity readings using an arduino setup.

# Methodology

The arduino code is written in C/C++ using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), while the data processing aspect of the code is written mainly in Python using the [pyserial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/) for serial output and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization.

# TODO

* Add timestamps to data
* Clean up code base
* Concurrent data readings
